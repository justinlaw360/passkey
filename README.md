# What is a Passkey?
A passkey is a modern and secure method for authenticating users without requiring traditional passwords. It leverages cryptographic keys that are stored on users' devices to authenticate their identity. Unlike passwords, passkeys are not vulnerable to phishing attacks or server breaches because they do not rely on shared secrets that can be intercepted or stolen.

# How is Passkey Related to MFA?
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity. Commonly, MFA involves something the user knows (a password), something the user has (a security token or smartphone), and something the user is (biometric verification).
Passkeys can be integrated into MFA systems to provide an additional layer of security. They can serve as a second factor or even replace traditional passwords, making the authentication process more secure and user-friendly. For instance, a user might use a passkey stored on their mobile device alongside biometric authentication to access a secured service.

# Benefits of Passkey
**Enhanced Security**

Passkeys provide a higher level of security compared to passwords. Since they use cryptographic methods, they are resistant to common attacks such as phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force attacks. Passkeys ensure that only the legitimate user can access their accounts, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**User Convenience**

Passkeys simplify the authentication process for users. They eliminate the need to remember and manage multiple complex passwords. Users can authenticate using their devices, often with a single tap or biometric verification, making the login process faster and more convenient.

**Phishing Resistance**

Since passkeys do not rely on shared secrets, they are immune to phishing attacks. Even if a malicious actor attempts to trick a user into revealing their credentials, the passkey remains secure because it cannot be transmitted or intercepted in the same way as a password.

**Reduced Password Fatigue**

Passkeys alleviate the burden of password fatigue, where users struggle to create and remember multiple strong passwords. By replacing passwords with passkeys, users experience less frustration and are less likely to resort to insecure practices, such as reusing passwords across multiple sites.  Passkeys are often referred to as a passwordless solution.

**Improved User Experience**

Passkeys can streamline the user experience by reducing the steps required for authentication. This simplicity can lead to higher user satisfaction and reduced friction during the login process, encouraging users to adopt secure practices more readily.

**Lower Maintenance Costs**

Organizations can benefit from reduced maintenance costs associated with password management. Passkeys eliminate the need for frequent password resets and diminish the workload on IT support teams, allowing them to focus on other critical tasks.

**Compatibility with Modern Devices**

Passkeys are designed to work seamlessly with modern devices that support cryptographic authentication methods. As more devices adopt these standards, the usability and convenience of passkeys will continue to improve, making them an increasingly attractive option for securing user accounts.

In conclusion, passkeys represent a significant advancement in user authentication, offering enhanced security, convenience, and resistance to phishing attacks. When integrated into MFA systems, they provide a robust solution that protects user accounts while simplifying the authentication process.

# Implementing Passkey as easy as pie
1.	Choose a Passkey Provider: Select a service that supports passkeys, such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft.  I tried hanko.io, it provides a free trial for few user accounts.
2.	Integrate with Your System: Use the providerâ€™s SDKs or APIs to integrate passkey functionality into your application or website.
3.	Set Up Biometric Authentication: Ensure that your users have devices capable of biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition).
